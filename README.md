# pandas-challenge

This is the delivery for module 4 challenge. In this repository you'll find the jupyter notebook file along with the resources where the code reads the data it uses.

These are the points observed after reviewing the data:
# PyCity Schools Analysis

- These are some of the points I was able to find after watching the data:

1) The district has a low approval percentaje
2) There is a big difference in the approval percentaje between district and charters schools
3) Top 5 schools by approval percentaje are charters school and are around 90%
4) Lowest 5 schools by approval percentaje are district and are around 50% 
5) Schools that have the best approval percentaje are not the schools that spend the most per student. All schools that are around 90% of approval spend less than 585 even with different amout of students
6) The more a school spend per student, the lower the overall approval percentaje the schools have
7) The bigger the school the worst approval percentaje they have
8) Reading approval percentaje is bigger than math approval percetaje

The two most points I get from the analysis of the data is:
1) Schools need to better utilize the budget. Spending more per student provides worst resutls, the amount is not important, the most important thing is to spend intelligently.
2) Schools need to limit the number of students. Schools with more students get the worst resutls.
